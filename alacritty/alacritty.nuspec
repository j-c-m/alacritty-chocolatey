    <description>Alacritty is focused on simplicity and performance. The performance goal means
it should be faster than any other terminal emulator available. The simplicity
goal means that it doesn't have features such as tabs or splits (which can be
better provided by a window manager or [terminal multiplexer](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)) nor
niceties like a GUI config editor.

The software is considered to be at an **alpha** level of readiness--there are
missing features and bugs to be fixed, but it is already used by many as a daily
driver.</description>
    <summary>Alacritty is the fastest terminal emulator in existence. Using the GPU for rendering enables optimizations that simply aren't possible in other emulators.</summary>
